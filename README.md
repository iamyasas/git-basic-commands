# git-basic-commands
Since I got limited memory ;)
This is to make a note of the git commands I use it & refer later.

1) git init - initialize a git repo (exisiting code/ empty)
2) git add . - add/stage current directory
3) git commit -m "initial commit" - commit the repo
4) git remote add origin htttps://your-remote-git-repo.git - add remote repo
5) git push origin branch-name - create/ update a branch to the remote repo/origin
6) git branch branch-name - create new branch from master
7) git checkout branch-name - switch to a branch
8) git merge branch-name - marge a branch with master(should switch to master branch before using checkout)
9) git fetch upstream - Sync local with remote(new branches and commits will sync with local)
