# git-basic-commands
Since I got limited memory ;)
This is to make a note of the git commands I use it & refer later.

git init - initialize a git repo (exisiting code/ empty)
git add . - add/stage current directory
git commit -m "initial commit" - commit the repo
git remote add origin htttps://your-remote-git-repo.git - add remote repo
git push -u origin master - checkin master branch to the remote repo/origin
